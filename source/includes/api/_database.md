## Databases

Cloudant databases contain JSON objects.
These JSON objects are called [documents](document.html#documents).
All documents must be contained in a database.

### Create

> Create a database

```http
PUT /$DATABASE HTTP/1.1
HOST: $ACCOUNT.cloudant.com
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE -X PUT
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+":"+$PASSWORD+"@"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");

account.db.create($DATABASE, function (err, body, headers) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log('database created!');
  }
});
```

To create a database, make a PUT request to `https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE`.

The database name must start with a lowercase letter and contain only the following characters:

 - Lowercase characters (a-z)
 - Digits (0-9)
 - Any of the characters _, $, (, ), +, -, and /
 
#### Database topology

It is possible to modify the configuration of a database sharding topology of a database on dedicated database clusters.
This can be done at the time a database is created.
However,
poor choice for configuration parameters can adversely affect database performance.

For more information about modifying database configuration in a dedicated database environment,
please contact Cloudant support.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="noconfigmod">It is not possible to modify the configuration used for databases on multi-tenant clusters.</aside>

#### Response

> Response for successful creation:

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

{
  "ok": true
}
```

If creation succeeds, you get a [201 or 202 response](http.html#201).
In case of an error,
the HTTP status code tells you what went wrong.

Code | Description
-----|--------------
201 |	Database created successfully
202 |	The database has been successfully created on some nodes, but the number of nodes is less than the write quorum.
403 |	Invalid database name.
412 |	Database aleady exists.

### Read

> Create a database

```http
GET /$DATABASE HTTP/1.1
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE \
     -u $USERNAME
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+":"+$PASSWORD+"@"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");

account.db.get($DATABASE, function (err, body, headers) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

Making a GET request against `https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE` returns details about the database,
such as how many documents it contains.

### Get Databases

> Get all databases

```http
GET /_all_dbs HTTP/1.1
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/_all_dbs \
     -u $USERNAME
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+":"+$PASSWORD+"@"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");

account.db.list(function (err, body, headers) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

To list all the databases in an account,
make a GET request against `https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/_all_dbs`.

<div></div>

> Example response:

```json
[
   "_users",
   "contacts",
   "docs",
   "invoices",
   "locations"
]
```

The response is an array with all database names.

### Get Documents

> Getting all documents in a database:

```http
GET /_all_docs HTTP/1.1
```

```shell
curl https://%USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_all_docs
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+":"+$PASSWORD+"@"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");
var db = account.use($DATABASE);

db.list(function (err, body, headers) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

> Getting all documents in a database that match at least one of the specified keys:

```http
GET /_all_docs?keys=["somekey","someotherkey"] HTTP/1.1
```

```shell
curl https://%USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_all_docs?keys=["somekey","someotherkey"]
```

To list all the documents in a database, make a GET request against `https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_all_docs`.

The `_all_docs` endpoint accepts these query arguments:

Argument | Description | Optional | Type | Default
---------|-------------|----------|------|--------
`descending` | Return the documents in descending by key order | yes | boolean | false
`endkey` | Stop returning records when the specified key is reached | yes | string |  
`include_docs` | Include the full content of the documents in the return | yes | boolean | false
`conflicts` | Can only be set if `include_docs` is `true`. Adds information about conflicts to each document. | yes | Boolean | false
`inclusive_end` | Include rows whose key equals the endkey | yes | boolean | true
`key` | Return only documents with IDs that match the specified key | yes | string |  
`keys` | Return only documents with IDs that match one of the specified keys | yes | list of strings |

      "rev": "2-cbdef49ef3ddc127eff86350844a6108"
    }
  }]
}
```

The response is a JSON object containing all documents in the database matching the parameters. The following table describes the meaning of the individual fields:

Field |	Description |	Type
------|-------------|-------
offset |	Offset where the document list started |	numeric
rows |	Array of document objects |	array
total_rows |	Number of documents in the database/view matching the parameters of the query |	numeric
update_seq |	Current update sequence for the database |	string

### Get Changes

> Example request to get list of changes made to documents in a database:

```http
GET /$DATABASE/_changes HTTP/1.1
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_changes \
     -u $USERNAME
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+":"+$PASSWORD+"@"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");

account.db.changes($DATABASE, function (err, body, headers) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

Making a GET request against `https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_changes` returns a list of changes made to documents in the database,
including insertions,
updates,
and deletions.

When a `_changes` request is received,
one replica of each shard of the database is asked to provide a list of changes.
These responses are combined and returned to the original requesting client.

`_changes` accepts these query arguments:

Argument&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description | Supported Values | Default 
---------|-------------|------------------|---------
`descending` | Return the changes in sequential order | boolean | false | 
`feed` | Type of feed | `"continuous"`, `"longpoll"`, `"normal"` | `"normal"`
`filter` | Name of filter function from a design document to get updates | string | no filter
`heartbeat` | Time in milliseconds after which an empty line is sent during longpoll or continuous if there have been no changes | any positive number | no heartbeat | 
`include_docs` | Include the document with the result | boolean | false |
`conflicts` | Can only be set if `include_docs` is `true`. Adds information about conflicts to each document. | boolean | false 
`limit` | Maximum number of rows to return | any non-negative number | none |  
`since` | Start the results from changes _after_ the specified sequence identifier. In other words, using `since` excludes from the list all changes up to and including the specified sequence identifier. If `since` is 0 (the default), or omitted, the request returns all changes. If it is `now`, only changes made after the time of the request will be emitted. | sequence identifier or `now` | 0 | 
`style` | Specifies how many revisions are returned in the changes array. The default, `main_only`, only returns the current "winning" revision; `all_docs` returns all leaf revisions, including conflicts and deleted former conflicts. | `main_only`, `all_docs` | `main_only` | 
`timeout` | Number of milliseconds to wait for data before terminating the response. If heartbeat supersedes timeout if both are supplied. | any positive number | |
`doc_ids` | To be used only when `filter` is set to `_doc_ids`. Filters the feed so that only changes to the specified documents are sent. <br>**Note**: The `doc_ids` parameter only works with versions of Cloudant that are compatible with CouchDB 2.0. See [API: GET / documentation](https://docs.cloudant.com/advanced.html#get-/) for more information. | A JSON array of document IDs | |

<!--
`doc_ids` | To be used only when `filter` is set to `_doc_ids`. Filters the feed so that only changes to the specified documents are sent. | A JSON array of document IDs | |
-->

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="includedocsperformance2">Note that using `include_docs=true` might have [performance implications](creating_views.html#include_docs_caveat).</aside>

All arguments are optional.

The `feed` argument changes how Cloudant sends the response.
By default,
`_changes` reports all changes,
then the connection closes.

If you set `feed=longpoll`,
requests to the server remain open until changes are reported.
This can help monitor changes specifically instead of continuously.

If you set `feed=continuous`,
new changes are reported without closing the connection.
In this mode,
the format of the report entries reflects the continuous nature of the changes,
while ensuring validity of the JSON output.

The `filter` parameter designates a pre-defined [filter function](design_documents.html#filter-functions) to apply to the changes feed.
Additionally, there is a built-in filter available:

<!--
 * `_doc_ids`: This filter accepts only changes for documents whose ID is specified in the `doc_ids` parameter.
-->

 * `_design`: The `_design` filter accepts only changes to design documents.

  "pending": 0
}
```

The response is a JSON object containing a list of the changes made to documents within the database.
The following table describes the meaning of the individual fields:

Field&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description | Type
------|-------------|------
`changes` | Array, listing the changes made to the specific document. | Array
`deleted` | Boolean indicating if the corresponding document was deleted. If present, it always has the value `true`. | Boolean
`id` | Document identifier | String
`last_seq` | Identifier of the last of the sequence identifiers. Currently this is the same as the sequence identifier of the last item in the `results`. | String
`results` | Array of changes made to the database. | Array
`seq` | Update sequence identifier | String

When using `_changes`,
you should be aware that:

-	If a `since` value is specified, only changes that have arrived in the specified replicas of the shards are returned in the response.
-	If the specified replicas of the shards in any given `since` value are unavailable, alternative replicas are selected, and the last known checkpoint between them is used. If this happens, you might see changes again that you have previously seen. Therefore, an application making use of the `_changes` feed should be '[idempotent](http://www.eaipatterns.com/IdempotentReceiver.html)', that is, able to receive the same data multiple times, safely.
-	The results returned by `_changes` are partially ordered. In other words, the order is not guaranteed to be preserved for multiple calls. You might decide to get a current list using `_changes` which includes the [`last_seq` value](database.html#changes_responses), then use this as the starting point for subsequent `_changes` lists by providing the `since` query argument.
-	Although shard copies of the same range contain the same data, their `_changes` history is often unique. This is a result of how writes have been applied to the shard. For example, they may have been applied in a different order. To be sure all changes are reported for your specified sequence, it might be necessary to go further back into the shard's history to find a suitable starting point from which to start reporting the changes. This might give the appearance of duplicate updates, or updates that seem to be 'before' the specified `since` value.

`_changes` from each shard are always presented in order.
But the ordering between all the contributing shards might appear to be different.

If you request `feed=continuous`,
the database connection stays open until explicitly closed.
All changes are returned to the client as soon as possible after they occur.

Each line in the continuous response is either empty or a JSON object representing a single change.

<div> </div>

#### POST

> Example of `POST`ing to the `_changes` endpoint

```http
POST /$DB/_changes HTTP/1.1
Host: $USERNAME.cloudant.com
Content-Type: application/json
```

```shell
curl -X POST "https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DB/_changes" -d @request.json
```

```json
{
  "limit": 10
}
```

Instead of `GET`, you can also use `POST` to query the changes feed. The only difference to the `GET` method is that parameters are specified in a JSON object in the request body.

### Deleting a database

> Example request to delete a Cloudant database:

```http
DELETE /$DATABASE HTTP/1.1
Host: $USERNAME.cloudant.com
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE \
     -X DELETE \
     -u $USERNAME
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+":"+$PASSWORD+"@"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");

account.db.destroy($DATABASE, function (err, body, headers) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

To delete a databases and its contents, make a DELETE request to `https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE`.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="deletecheck">There is no additional check to ensure that you really intended to delete the database ("Are you sure?").</aside>

<div></div>

> Example response:

```
{
  "ok": true
}
```

The response confirms successful deletion of the database or describes any errors that occured, i.e. if you try to delete a database that does not exist.
