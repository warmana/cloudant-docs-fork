# ![alt tag](images/guide_icon.png) Cloudant Features

## Much More Than A Hosted database

Cloudant is a NoSQL database as a service (DBaaS) built from the ground up to scale globally (think CDN for your database), run non-stop, and handle a wide variety of data types like JSON, full-text, and geo spatial. Cloudant is an operational data store optimized to handle concurrent reads & writes, and provide high availability and data durability.

## Scalable, Fault-tolerant JSON Data Store

Self-describing JSON "documents" are automatically stored, indexed, and distributed across an elastic database cluster that can span multiple racks, data centers, or cloud providers to provide superior scalability and availability.

## Multi-master Replication Across Data Centers

Cloudant increases scale and uptime, and reduces read-write latency by replicating and synchronizing readable - and writable - copies of data across multiple data centers or devices. Geo load balancers connect users with the closest replica.

## Cloudant Sync for Occasionally Connected Apps

Cloudant Sync pushes database access to the farthest edge of the network —mobile devices, remote facilities, sensors, and internet-enabled goods, so that you can scale bigger and enable client apps to continue running off-line.

## Lucene-powered Cloudant Search

The easiest way to build scalable search apps. Cloudant Search features ranked searching, powerful query types, results bookmarking, faceted search, fielded searching, and more.

## Advanced 2D and 3D Geo-spatial indexing

Enrich your app with geo-location services using built-in geo-hashing, proximity, bounding (box, radius, ellipse, polygon), and intersection queries.

## Real-time Analytics with Incremental MapReduce

Indexing and views are defined via MapReduce functions and can be based on any number of JSON fields in your database. Indexes are updated incrementally as data changes to enable real-time analytics.

## RESTful API

Get, Put, Index, and Query JSON documents directly from the browser via a RESTful API over secure HTTP/S.

## [Data Protection and Security](dbaassecurity.html)

Data access control, encryption, and data backup features enable customers in financial services, government, e-commerce, telecommunications, healthcare, and other security-minded industries to benefit from Cloudant DBaaS.

## [Cloudant Security Compliance](cloudantcompliance.html)

Cloudant provides a trustworthy and secure cloud database platform. The service is built on best-in-industry standards, including ISO 27001 and ISO 27002.

## Multiple hosting options

Never worry about cloud lock-in. Cloudant supports a variety of hosting options to fit your budget and performance needs. Choose between Rackspace, IBM SoftLayer, AWS, Windows Azure, or Joyent, and even change platforms on demand.

## Managed by big-data experts at Cloudant

Big data experts at Cloudant grow (reconfigure, repartition/rebalance clusters), protect and administer your data layer around the clock so you can get a good night’s sleep.
