# Sync

The Cloudant Sync library is used to store, index and query local JSON data on a mobile device.
It is also used to synchronise data between many devices.
Synchronisation is controlled by your application.
The library also provides helper methods for finding and resolving conflicts,
both in the local device and the remote database.

Two versions are available:

- [Cloudant Sync - Android / JavaSE](https://github.com/cloudant/sync-android)
- [Cloudant Sync - iOS (CDTDatastore)](https://github.com/cloudant/CDTDatastore)
