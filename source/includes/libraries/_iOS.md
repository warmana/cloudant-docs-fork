# iOS and OS&nbsp;X

A supported library is available for working with Cloudant using Objective-C on iOS, and using Swift on OS&nbsp;X.
The library is called ObjectiveCloudant,
and is installed using `cocoapods`.

The Podfile entry is:

```
pod 'ObjectiveCloudant'
```

More information about ObjectiveCloudant,
including details of installation and how to use the library to store, index and query remote JSON data on Cloudant,
is available on [its github page](https://github.com/cloudant/objective-cloudant).

The library is an early release version and thus does not currently cover the Cloudant API completely.
