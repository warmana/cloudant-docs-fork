# ![alt tag](images/libraries_icon.png) Client Libraries

Client libraries are the tools that let you develop your own applications to work with Cloudant databases.

The following client libraries are formally [supported](libraries.html#supported-client-libraries) by Cloudant.

-	[Cloudant Sync](libraries-sync.html)
-	[Java](libraries-java.html)
-	[Node.js](libraries-nodejs.html)
-	[Meteor](libraries-meteor.html)
-	[Python](libraries-python.html)
-	[Objective C and Swift](libraries-iOS.html)

A supported library is one where you can contact Cloudant if you encounter a specific, reproducible problem with the library.

Other client libraries have been created by third parties.

- [Ruby](libraries-ruby.html)
- [PHP](libraries-php.html)
- [PouchDB](libraries-nodejs.html#PouchDB)
- [.Net](libraries-dotnet.html)

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="notmaintained">Third-party client libraries are not maintained or supported by Cloudant.
If you encounter a specific, reproducible problem with a third-party library,
you should contact the library maintainer for assistance.</aside> 

If a library for your preferred language is not available,
why not [let us know?](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/slate/issues)
