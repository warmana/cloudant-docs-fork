## Cloud Consumption Model

<aside role="complementary" aria-label="availability">The Cloud Consumption Model (CCM) is a new plan-based pricing model,
available on [Bluemix Public regions](ccm.html#locations).</aside>

The CCM offers a number of performance and pricing plans
for using [Cloudant on Bluemix](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/Cloudant/index.html#Cloudant).

The plan prices range from free,
through to several thousand dollars per month,
depending on the configuration you choose.




### CCM Accounts

By default,
accounts created on [`cloudant.com`](https://cloudant.com/) do not use the CCM.
As the CCM is made available on Cloudant clusters,
you are able to create an account directly that specifies use of the CCM and your chosen plan.

If you already have a Cloudant account on [Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/)
that was created before CCM was made available),
the account is not using the CCM plans.
To create a Bluemix account with a CCM plan,
create a new account on Bluemix,
then replicate your data from the old Bluemix account into the new Bluemix account.

When your account is using CCM,
plan changes can be made at any time during the month.
However,
you are charged at the rate of the highest priced plan configuration that is used during the hour when the plan changes.
Also,
a slight delay normally occurs between the opening of plan change request,
and the fulfillment of the provisioned throughput capacity.
