## Database as a Service

Cloudant is a hosted and fully-managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS).
It is built from the ground up to scale globally,
run non-stop,
and handle a wide variety of data types like [JSON](basics.html#json),
[full-text](cloudant_query.html#creating-an-index),
and [geospatial](geo.html).
Cloudant is an operational data store optimized to handle concurrent reads and writes,
and enables high availability and data durability.

It provides an [HTTP API](basics.html#http-api) for working with your [JSON](basics.html#json) data,
and 24-hour operational support and maintenance.
Cloudant is based on [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/),
and is delivered as various multi-tenant, dedicated, and installed services.

The Cloudant DBaaS offering is available through [https://cloudant.com/](https://cloudant.com/).
It is offered as either a [Shared Plan](offerings.html#shared-plan),
or an [Enterprise (Dedicated) Plan](offerings.html#enterprise-plan).

### Shared Plan

With the Cloudant Shared Plan,
you have access to all the Cloudant DBaaS capabilities,
provided through a shared or 'multi-tenant' cluster.

Pricing is metered,
based on your monthly usage.
There is no charge if your monthly usage is under $50.00 (as at August 2016).

### Enterprise Plan

With the Cloudant DBaaS Enterprise Plan,
you have access to all the Cloudant DBaaS capabilities,
provided through a dedicated, single-tenant cluster.

This gives you assured database performance and up-time,
using dedicated DBaaS clusters or hardware available at various hosting locations.
