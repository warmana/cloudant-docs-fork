## Grouping related documents together in Cloudant

Traditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined together to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information. Relational databases offer high consistency meaning that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths, including using joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.

Cloudant favors availability over consistency. It is a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. This gives the advantage that the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with multiple users making purchases at the same time. This means that your application can utilize Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.

This example will demonstrate how to build an e-commerce system and take advantage of Cloudant's strengths by using concepts that are applicable to many other domains.

-	Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.
-	Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.
-	Creating views to collate documents by `order_id` to reflect the current state of a purchase.
 
 
> Example shopping app's documents

```
{
  "_id": "023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e",
  "type": "purchase",
  "order_id": "320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383",
  "basket": [
     {
       "product_id": "A56",
       "title": "Adele - 25",
       "category": "Audio CD",
       "price": 8.33,
       "tax": 0.2,
       "quantity": 2
      },
      {
        "product_id": "B32",
        "title": "The Lady In The Van - Alan Bennett",
        "category": "Paperback book",
        "price": 3.49,
        "tax": 0,
        "quantity": 2
      }
   ],
  "account_id": "985522332",
  "delivery": {
    "option": "Next Day",
    "price": 2.99,
    "address": {
      "street": "17 Front Street",
      "town": "Middlemarch",
      "postcode": "W1A 1AA"
    }
  },
  },
  "pretax" : 20.15,
  "tax" : 3.32,
  "total": 26.46
}
```


In this example, you create a `purchase` document that contains the items ordered, customer's information, cost, and delivery information:
<div></div>


This provides enough data for a purchase record to render a summary of an order on a web page, or an email, without fetching additional records. Notice the order's details in the following list:
 
-	The basket contains reference ids (`product_id`) to a database of products stored elsewhere.
-	The basket duplicates some of the product data in this record, enough to record the state of the items purchased at the point of sale.
-	The document does not contain fields that mark the status of the order. Additional documents will be added later to record payments and delivery.
-	The database automatically generates a document `_id` when it inserts the document into the database.
-	A unique identifier (`order_id`) is supplied with each purchase record to reference the order later. 
 
When the customer places an order, typically when the customer enters the "checkout" phase on the website, a purchase order record is created. 

###Generating your own unique identifiers (UUIDs)
 
In a relational database, sequential "auto incrementing" numbers are often used, but in distributed databases, where data is spread around of cluster of servers, longer UUIDs are used to ensure that documents are stored with their own unique id.
   
To create a unique identifier to use in your application, such as an `order_id`, call the `GET _uuids` endpoint on the Cloudant API and the database will generate an identifier for you. Refer to [Get/_UUIDS](advanced.html#get-/_uuids)  in the Advanced section of the Cloudant API reference. The same endpoint can be used to generate multiple ids by adding a `count` parameter, for example, `/_uuids?count=10`.

###Recording payments

> Payment record

```
{
  "_id": "bf70c30ea5d8c3cd088fef98ad678e9e",
  "type": "payment",
  "account_id": "985522332",
  "order_id": "320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383",
  "value": 6.46,
  "method": "credit card",
  "payment_reference": "AB9977G244FF2F667"
}
{
   "_id": "12c0ea6cd3d2c6e3b1d34442aea6a2d9",
   "type": "payment",
   "account_id": "985522332",
   "order_id": "320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383",
   "value": 20.00,
   "method": "voucher",
   "payment_reference": "Q88775662377224"
}
```


If the customer successfully pays for their items, additional records are added to the database to record the order:
<div></div>

In this example, the customer paid by supplying a credit card and redeeming a pre-paid voucher. The total of the two payments added up to the amount of the order. Each payment was written to Cloudant as a separate document. You can see the status of an order by creating a view of everything you know about an `order_id` as a ledger containing the following information: 
 
-	Purchase totals as positive numbers
-	Payments against the account as negative numbers

> Map function

```
function (doc) {
  if (doc.type === 'purchase') {
    emit(doc.order_id, doc.total);
  } else{
    if (doc.type === 'payment') {
      emit(doc.order_id, -doc.value);
    }
  }
}

```

The following example shows the Map function: 

<div></div>

> Built-in `_sum` reducer

```
{
"total_rows":3,"offset":0,"rows":[
	{"id":"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383","key":"985522332","value":26.46},
	{"id":"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383","key":"985522332","value":-20},
	{"id":"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383","key":"985522332","value":-6.46}
	]
 }
```

Select the built-in `_sum` reducer which produces output either as a ledger of payment events (queried with ?reduce=false): 
<div></div>

> Totals grouped by `order_id`

```
{
"rows":[
 	{"key":"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383","value":0}
 ]
 }
``` 

or as totals grouped by `order_id` (?group_level=1):
<div></div>

Since the view in this example returns 0 for this order, the result indicates that the order is fully paid, because the positive purchase order total cancels out the negative payment amounts. Recording events as separate documents, e.g., one for the order and one for each payment, is good practice in Cloudant, since it avoids the possibility of creating conflicts when multiple processes modify the same document simultaneously.

###Adding additional documents

You can add additional, separate documents to the database to record the following states as the order is provisioned and dispatched:

-	Dispatch notifications
-	Delivery receipts
-	Refund records

As the data arrives, Cloudant writes to each document separately. Therefore, it is not necessary to modify the core purchase document.

###Advantages of storing purchase orders in Cloudant

Using Cloudant to store purchase order information allows an ordering system to be highly available and scalable to deal with large volumes of data and high rates of concurrent access. By modeling the data in separate documents that are only written once, we can ensure that documents never become conflicted, such as during concurrent access to the same document by separate processes.

Furthermore, documents can contain copies of data that exists in other collections to represent rather than rely on joining data with a foreign key (for example, when recording the state of a basket at the time of purchase). This allows an order's state to be fetched by a single call to a Cloudant's view that groups documents related by `order_id`.
