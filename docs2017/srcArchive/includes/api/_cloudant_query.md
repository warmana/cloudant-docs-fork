## Query

Cloudant Query is a declarative JSON querying syntax for Cloudant databases.
Cloudant Query wraps several index types, starting with the Primary Index out-of-the-box.
Cloudant Query indexes can also be built using MapReduce Views (where the index type is `json`),
and Search Indexes (where the index type is `text`).

If you know exactly what data you want to look for,
or you want to keep storage and processing requirements to a minimum,
you can specify how the index is created,
by making it of type `json`.

But for maximum possible flexibility when looking for data,
you would typically create an index of type `text`.
Indexes of type `text` have a simple mechanism for automatically indexing all the fields in the documents.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="texttakeslonger">While more flexible,
`text` indexes might take longer to create and require more storage resources than `json` indexes.</aside>

### Creating an index

You can create an index with one of two types:

-	`"type": "json"`
-	`"type": "text"`

<div></div>

#### Creating a "type=json" index

> Example of creating a new index for the field called `foo`:

```shell
POST /db/_index HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
    "index": {
        "fields": ["foo"]
    },
    "name" : "foo-index",
    "type" : "json"
}
```

> The returned JSON confirms the index has been created:

```json
{
    "result": "created"
}
```

To create a JSON index in the database $DB, make a `POST` request to `/$DB/_index` with a JSON object describing the index in the request body. The `type` field of the JSON object has to be set to `"json"`.

##### Request Body format

-   **index**:
    -   **fields**: A JSON array of field names following the [sort syntax](#sort-syntax). Nested fields are also allowed, e.g. `"person.name"`.
-   **ddoc (optional)**: Name of the design document in which the index will be created. By default, each index will be created in its own design document. Indexes can be grouped into design documents for efficiency. However, a change to one index in a design document will invalidate all other indexes in the same document.
-   **type (optional)**: Can be ``"json"`` or ``"text"``. Defaults to json. Geospatial indexes will be supported in the future.
-   **name (optional)**: Name of the index. If no name is provided, a name will be generated automatically.

##### Return Codes

Code | Description
-----|------------
200 | Index has been created successfully or already existed
400 | Bad request: the request body does not have the specified format

<div></div>

#### Creating a "type=text" index

> Simple example index creation request

```json
{
	"index": {
		"fields": [
			{
				"name": "Movie_name",
				"type": "string"
			}
		]
	},
	"name": "Movie_name-text",
	"type": "text"
}
```

> More complex example index creation request

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "name": "my-index",
  "ddoc": "my-index-design-doc",
  "index": {
    "default_field": {
      "enabled": true,
      "analyzer": "german"
    }
    "selector": {},
    "fields": [
      {"name": "married", "type": "boolean"},
      {"name": "lastname", "type": "string"},
      {"name": "year-of-birth", "type": "number"}
    ]
  }
}
```

While it is generally recommended that you create a single text index with the default values,
there are a few useful index attributes that can be modified.

Remember that for Full Text Indexes (FTIs),
`type` should be set to `text`.

The `name` and `ddoc` attributes are for grouping indexes into design documents,
and allowing you to refer to them by a custom string value.
If no values are supplied for these fields,
they are automatically populated with a hash value.

If you create multiple text indexes in a database,
with the same `ddoc` value,
you need to know at least the `ddoc` value as well as the `name` value.
Creating multiple indexes with the same `ddoc` value places them into the
same design document. Generally, you should put each text index into its own design document.

<!--
"w": "2",
The `w` value affects the consistency of the index creation operation. In general use, you
shouldn't have to worry about this, but if you create test or example scripts that attempt to use
the index immediately after use, it can be useful to set this to `3`, so that a complete quorum is
used for the creation. It does not affect anything other than index creation.
-->

For more details on how text indexes work,
see the [note about `text` indexes](cloudant_query.html#note-about-text-indexes).

<div></div>

##### The `index` field

The `index` field contains settings specific to text indexes.

To index all fields in all documents automatically,
use the simple syntax:

  `"index": {}`

The indexing process traverses all of the fields in all the documents in the database.

An example of creating a text index for all fields in all documents in a database is [available](cloudant_query.html#example:-movies-demo-database).

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="avoidindexingallfields">Caution should be taken when indexing all fields in all documents for large data sets,
as it might be a very resource-consuming activity.</aside>

> Example index creation request to index all fields in all documents

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "index": {}
}
```

##### The `default_field` field

The `default_field` value specifies how the `$text` operator can be used with the index.

The `default_field` contains two keys:

Key | Description
-----|------------
`"enabled"` | Enable or disable the `default_field index` (default value: `true`).
`"analyzer"` | Specifies the Lucene analyzer to use (default value: `"standard"`).

The `analyzer` key in the `default_field` specifies how the index analyzes text.
The index can subsequently be queried using the `$text` operator.
See the [Cloudant Search documentation](search.html#analyzers) for alternative analyzers.
You might choose to use an alternative analyzer when documents are indexed in languages other than English,
or when you have other special requirements for the analyser such as matching email addresses.

If the `default_field` is not specified,
or is supplied with an empty object,
it defaults to `true` and the `"standard"` analyzer is used.

##### The `selector` field

The `selector` field can be used to limit the index to a specific set of documents that match a query.
It uses the same syntax used for selectors in queries.
This can be used if your application requires different documents to be indexed in different ways,
or if some documents should not be indexed at all.
If you only need to distinguish documents by type,
it is easier to use one index and add the type to the search query.

##### The `fields` array

The `fields` array contains a list of fields that should be indexed for each document.
If you know that an index queries only on specific fields,
then this field can be used to limit the size of the index.
Each field must also specify a type to be indexed.
The acceptable types are:

-	`"boolean"`
-	`"string"`
-	`"number"`

##### The `index_array_lengths` field

> Suggested settings to optimize performance on production systems

```json
default_field": {
   "enabled": false
},
"index_array_lengths": false
```

Cloudant Query text indexes have a property `index_array_lengths`.
If the property is not explicitly set,
the default value is `true`.

If the field is set to `true`,
the index performs additional work,
scanning every document for any arrays and creating a field to hold the length for each array found.

You might prefer to set the `index_array_lengths` field to `false` if:

-	You do not need to know the length of an array.
- You do not use the [`$size` operator](cloudant_query.html#the-$size-operator).
-	The documents in your database are complex, or not completely under your control, making it difficult to estimate the impact of the extra processing overhead to determine and store the array lengths.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="sizerequiresindexarraylengthstrue">The [`$size` operator](cloudant_query.html#the-$size-operator) requires that the `index_array_lengths` field is set to `true`,
otherwise the operator cannot work.</aside>

### Query Parameters

The format of the `selector` field is as described in the [selector syntax](#selector-syntax),
with the exception of the new `$text` operator.

The `$text` operator is based on a Lucene search with a standard analyzer.
This means the operator is not case sensitive, and matches on any words.
However,
the `$text` operator does not support full Lucene syntax,
such as wildcards,
fuzzy matches,
or proximity detection.
For more information on the available Lucene syntax,
see [Cloudant Search documentation](search.html#search).
The `$text` operator applies to all strings found in the document.
It is invalid to place this operator in the context of a field name.

The `fields` array is a list of fields that should be returned for each document. The provided
field names can use dotted notation to access subfields.

> [Example using all available query parameters](try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=year2010ascending)

```json
{
  "selector": {
    "year": {
      "$gt": 2010
    }
  },
  "fields": ["_id", "_rev", "year", "title"],
  "sort": [{"year": "asc"}],
  "limit": 10,
  "skip": 0
}
```

### Working with indexes

Cloudant endpoints can be used to create, list,
update,
and delete indexes in a database,
and to query data using these indexes.

A list of the available methods and endpoints follows:

Method | Path | Description
-------|------|------------
`POST` | `/db/_index` | Create a new index
`GET` | `/db/_index` | List all Cloudant Query indexes
`DELETE` | `/db/_index` | Delete an index
`POST`| `/db/_find` | Find documents using an index

### List all Cloudant Query indexes

-   **Method**: `GET`
-   **URL Path**: `/db/_index`
-   **Response Body**: JSON object describing the indexes
-   **Roles permitted**: \_reader

When you make a `GET` request to `/db/_index`, you get a list of all indexes used by Cloudant Query in the database, including the primary index. In addition to the information available through this API, indexes are also stored in design documents &lt;index-functions&gt;. Design documents are regular documents that have an ID starting with `_design/`. Design documents can be retrieved and modified in the same way as any other document, although this is not necessary when using Cloudant Query.

#### Response body format

-   **indexes**: Array of indexes
    -   **ddoc**: ID of the design document the index belongs to. This ID can be used to retrieve the design document containing the index,
    by making a `GET` request to `/db/ddoc`, where `ddoc` is the value of this field.
    -   **name**: Name of the index.
    -   **type**: Type of the index. Currently "json" is the only supported type.
    -   **def**: Definition of the index, containing the indexed fields and the sort order: ascending or descending.

> An example of a response body with two indexes

```json
{
    "indexes": [
        {
            "ddoc": "_design/2ec1805041b2c3dcdef1d07a8ea1dc51ba3decfa",
            "name": "foo-bar-index",
            "type": "json",
            "def": {
                "fields": [
                    {"foo":"asc"},
                    {"bar":"asc"}
                ]
            }
        },
        {
            "ddoc": "_design/1f003ce73056238720c2e8f7da545390a8ea1dc5",
            "name": "baz-index",
            "type": "json",
            "def": {
                "fields": [
                    {"baz":"desc"}
                 ]
             }
         }
    ]
}
```

### Deleting an index

-   **Method**: `DELETE`
-   **URL Path**: `/$db/_index/$designdoc/$type/$name` where $db is the name of the database, $designdoc is the ID of the design document, $type is the type of the index (for example "json"),
and $name is the name of the index.
-   **Response Body**: JSON object indicating successful deletion of the index, or describing any error encountered.
-   **Request Body**: None
-   **Roles permitted**: \_writer

### Finding documents using an index

-   **Method**: `POST`
-   **URL Path**: `/db/_find`
-   **Response Body**: JSON object describing the query results
-   **Roles permitted**: \_reader

#### Request body

-	**selector**: JSON object describing criteria used to select documents. More information provided in the section on [selectors](#selector-syntax).
-	**limit (optional, default: 25)**: Maximum number of results returned.
-	**skip (optional, default: 0)**: Skip the first 'n' results, where 'n' is the value specified.
-	**sort (optional, default: [])**: JSON array following [sort syntax](#sort-syntax)
-	**fields (optional, default: null)**: JSON array following the field syntax, described in the following information. This parameter lets you specify which fields of an object should be returned. If it is omitted, the entire object is returned.
-	**r (optional, default: 1)**: Read quorum needed for the result. This defaults to 1, in which case the document found in the index is returned. If set to a higher value, each document is read from at least that many replicas before it is returned in the results. This is likely to take more time than using only the document stored locally with the index.
-	**bookmark (optional, default: null)**: A string that enables you to specify which page of results you require. *Only for indexes of type `text`.*
-	**use_index (optional)**: Use this option to identify a specific index for query to run against, rather than using the Cloudant Query algorithm to find the best index. For more information, see [Explain Plans](#explain-plans).

The `bookmark` field is used for paging through result sets. Every query returns an opaque
string under the `bookmark` key that can then be passed back in a query to get the next page of
results. If any part of the query other than `bookmark` changes between requests, the results are
undefined.

The `limit` and `skip` values are exactly as you would expect. While `skip` exists, it is not
intended to be used for paging. The reason is that the `bookmark` feature
is more efficient.

> [Example request body for finding documents using an index](try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=year2010ascending):

```json
{
    "selector": {
        "year": {"$gt": 2010}
    },
    "fields": ["_id", "_rev", "year", "title"],
    "sort": [{"year": "asc"}],
    "limit": 10,
    "skip": 0
}
```

#### Response body

-   **docs**: Array of documents matching the search. In each matching document, the fields specified in the `fields` part of the request body are listed, along with their values.

> Example response when finding documents using an index:

```json
{
    "docs":[
        {
            "_id": "2",
            "_rev": "1-9f0e70c7592b2e88c055c51afc2ec6fd",
            "foo": "test",
            "bar": 2600000
        },
        {
            "_id": "1",
            "_rev": "1-026418c17a353a9b73a6ccac19c142a4",
            "foo":"another test",
            "bar":9800000
        }
    ]
}
```

### Selector Syntax

The Cloudant Query language is expressed as a JSON object describing documents of interest. Within this structure, you can apply conditional logic using specially named fields.

<aside class="notice" role="complementary" aria-label="cloudantquerydifferentmongodbquery">While the Cloudant Query language has some similarities with MongoDB query documents,
these arise from a similarity of purpose and do not necessarily extend to commonality of function or result.</aside>

#### Selector basics

Elementary selector syntax requires you to specify one or more fields, and the corresponding values required for those fields. This selector matches all documents whose `"director"` field has the value `"Lars von Trier"`.

> [A simple selector](try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=simple)

```json
"selector": {
  "director": "Lars von Trier"
}
```

<div></div>

If you created a full text index by specifying `"type":"text"` when the index was created,
you can use the `$text` operator to select matching documents.
In this example,
the full text index is inspected to find any document that includes the word "Bond".

> [A simple selector for a full text index](try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=bond)

```json
"selector": {
  "$text": "Bond"
}
```

<div></div>

In this example,
the full text index is inspected to find any document that includes the word "Bond". In the response, the fields `title` or `cast` are returned for every matching object.

> [A simple selector, inspecting specific fields](try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=bond-title-cast)

```json
"selector": {
  "$text": "Bond"
},
"fields": [
  "title",
  "cast"
]
```

<div></div>

You can create more complex selector expressions by combining operators.
However, for Cloudant Query indexes of type `json`,
you cannot use 'combination' or 'array logical' operators such as `$regex` as the *basis* of a query.
Only the equality operators such as `$eq`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, and `$lte` (but not `$ne`) can be used as the basis of a more complex query.
For more information about creating complex selector expressions, see [Creating selector expressions](#creating-selector-expressions).

<div></div>

#### Selector with two fields

This selector matches any document with a `name` field containing "Paul",
_and_ that also has a `location` field with the value "Boston".

> [A more complex selector](try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=trier2003)

```json
"selector": {
  "name": "Paul",
  "location": "Boston"
}
```

### Subfields

A more complex selector enables you to specify the values for field of nested objects, or subfields.
For example, you might use a standard JSON structure for specifying a field and subfield.

> [Example of a field and subfield selector, using a standard JSON structure:](try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=imdb-rating-8)

```json
"selector": {
  "imdb": {
    "rating": 8
  }
}
```

<div></div>

An abbreviated equivalent uses a dot notation to combine the field and subfield names into a single name.

> Example of an equivalent dot-notation field and subfield selector:

```json
"selector": {
  "imdb.rating": 8
}
```

### Operators

Operators are identified by the use of a dollar sign (`$`) prefix in the name field.

There are two core types of operators in the selector syntax:

- Combination operators
- Condition operators

In general, combination operators are applied at the topmost level of selection.
They are used to combine conditions, or to create combinations of conditions, into one selector.

Every explicit operator has the form:

  `{"$operator": argument}`

A selector without an explicit operator is considered to have an implicit operator.
The exact implicit operator is determined by the structure of the selector expression.

### Implicit Operators

There are two implicit operators:

- Equality
- And

In a selector, any field containing a JSON value, but that has no operators in it, is considered to be an equality condition.
The implicit equality test applies also for fields and subfields.

Any JSON object that is not the argument to a condition operator is an implicit `$and` operator on each field.

> [Example selector using an operator to match any document, where the `age` field has a value greater than 20:](try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=after2010)

```json
"selector": {
  "year": {
    "$gt": 2010
  }
}
```

<div></div>

In this example, there must be a field `director` in a matching document, *and* the field must have a value exactly equal to "Lars von Trier".

> [Example of the implicit equality operator](/try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=simple)

```json
{
  "director": "Lars von Trier"
}
```

<div></div>

You can also make the equality operator explicit.

> Example of an explicit equality operator

```json
{
  "director": {
    "$eq": "Lars von Trier"
  }
}
```

<div></div>

In the example using subfields,
the required field `imdb` in a matching document *must* also have a subfield `rating` *and* the subfield *must* have a value equal to 8.

> [Example of implicit operator applied to a subfield test](/try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=imdb-rating-8)

```json
{
  "imdb": {
    "rating": 8
  }
}
```

<div></div>

Again, you can make the equality operator explicit.

> Example of an explicit equality operator

```json
"selector": {
  "imdb": {
    "rating": { "$eq": 8 }
  }
}
```

> [`$eq` operator used with full text indexing](try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=2010-by-title)

```json
{
  "selector": {
    "year": {
      "$eq": 2001
    }
  },
  "sort": [
    "title:string"
  ],
  "fields": [
    "title"
  ]
}
```

> `$eq` operator used with database indexed on the field `"year"`

```json
{
  "selector": {
    "year": {
      "$eq": 2001
    }
  },
  "sort": [
    "year"
  ],
  "fields": [
    "year"
  ]
}
```

<div></div>

In this example, the field `director` must be present and contain the value `"Lars von Trier"` _and_ the field `year` must exist and have the value `2003`.

> [Example of an implicit `$and` operator](try.html#requestType=cq&predefinedQuery=trier2003)

```json
{
  "director": "Lars von Trier",
  "year": 2003
}
```

<div id="combined-expressions"></div>

You can make both the `$and` operator and the equality operator explicit.

> Example of using explicit `$and` and `$eq` operators

```json
{
  "$and": [
    {
      "director": {
        "$eq": "Lars von Trier"
      }
    },
    {
      "year": {
        "$eq": 2003
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explicit operators

All operators,
apart from 'Equality' and 'And',
must be stated explicitly.

### Combination Operators

Combination operators are used to combine selectors.
In addition to the common boolean operators found in most programming languages,
there are two combination operators (`$all` and `$elemMatch`) that help you work with JSON arrays.

A combination operator takes a single argument.
The argument is either another selector, or an array of selectors.

The list of combination operators:

Operator | Argument | Purpose
---------|----------|--------
`$and` | Array | Matches if all the selectors in the array match.
`$or` | Array | Matches if any of the selectors in the array match. All selectors must use the same index.
`$not` | Selector | Matches if the given selector does not match.
`$nor` | Array | Matches if none of the selectors in the array match.
`$all` | Array | Matches an array value if it contains all the elements of the argument array.
`$elemMatch` | Selector | Matches and returns all documents that contain an array field with at least one element that matches all the specified query criteria.

<div></div>

#### Examples of combination operators

<div></div>
##### The `$and` operator

The `$and` operator matches if all the selectors in the array match.

### Condition Operators

Condition operators are specific to a field, and are used to evaluate the value stored in that field. For instance, the basic `$eq` operator matches when the specified field contains a value that is equal to the supplied argument.

The basic equality and inequality operators common to most programming languages are supported. In addition, some 'meta' condition operators are available. Some condition operators accept any valid JSON content as the argument. Other condition operators require the argument to be in a specific JSON format.

Operator type | Operator | Argument | Purpose
--------------|----------|----------|--------
(In)equality | `$lt` | Any JSON | The field is less than the argument.
 | `$lte` | Any JSON | The field is less than or equal to the argument.
 | `$eq` | Any JSON | The field is equal to the argument.
 | `$ne` | Any JSON | The field is not equal to the argument.
 | `$gte` | Any JSON | The field is greater than or equal to the argument.
 | `$gt` | Any JSON | The field is greater than the argument.
Object | `$exists` | Boolean | Check whether the field exists or not, regardless of its value.
 | `$type` | String | Check the document field's type. Valid values are "null", "boolean", "number", "string", "array", and "object".
Array | `$in` | Array of JSON values | The document field must exist in the list provided.
 | `$nin` | Array of JSON values | The document field must not exist in the list provided.
 | `$size` | Integer | Special condition to match the length of an array field in a document. Non-array fields cannot match this condition.
Miscellaneous | `$mod` | [Divisor, Remainder] | Divisor and Remainder are both positive or negative integers. Non-integer values result in a [404 status](http.html#404). Matches documents where (`field % Divisor == Remainder`) is true, and only when the document field is an integer.
 | `$regex` | String | A regular expression pattern to match against the document field. Only matches when the field is a string value and matches the supplied regular expression.

    }
  },

    "title",
    "cast"
  ],
  "limit": 10
}
```

### Creating selector expressions

We have seen examples of combining selector expressions,
such as [using explicit `$and` and `$eq` operators](cloudant-query.html#combined-expressions).
In general,
whenever you have an operator that takes an argument,
that argument can itself be another operator with arguments of its own.
This enables us to build up more complex selector expressions.

However, not all operators can be used as the base or starting point of the selector expression when using indexes of type `json`.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="querybasislimits">You cannot use combination or array logical operators such as `$regex` as the _basis_ of a query when using indexes of type `json`.
Only equality operators such as `$eq`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, and `$lte` (but not `$ne`) can be used as the basis of a query for `json` indexes.</aside>

<div></div>

For example,
if you try to perform a query that attempts to match all documents that have a field called `afieldname` containing a value that begins with the letter `A`,
you get an `error: "no_usable_index"` error message.

> Example of an invalid selector expression:

```json
{
  "selector": {
    "afieldname": {
      "$regex": "^A"
    }
  }
}
```

> Example response to an invalid selector expression:

```json
{
  error: "no_usable_index"
  reason: "There is no operator in this selector can used with an index."
}
```

<div></div>

A solution is to use an equality operator as the basis of the query.
You can add a 'null' or always true expression as the basis of the query.
For example,
you could first test that the document has an `_id` value:

  `"_id": { "$gt": null }`

This expression is always true,
enabling the remainder of the selector expression to be applied.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="fullscannotefficient">Using `{"_id": { "$gt":null } }` induces a full-table scan, and is not efficient for large databases.</aside>

Most selector expressions work exactly as you would expect for the given operator.
The matching algorithms used by the `$regex` operator are currently based on the Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library.
However, not all of the PCRE library is implemented,
and some parts of the `$regex` operator go beyond what PCRE offers.
For more information about what is implemented,
see the <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/re.html" target="_blank">Erlang Regular Expression</a> information.

> Example use of an equality operator to enable a selector expression:

```json
{
  "selector": {
    "_id": {
      "$gt": null
    },
    "afieldname": {
      "$regex": "^A"
    }
  }
}
```

### Sort Syntax

The `sort` field contains a list of field name and direction pairs,
expressed as a basic array.
The first field name and direction pair is the topmost level of sort.
The second pair,
if provided,
is the next level of sort.

The field can be any field,
using dotted notation if desired for sub-document fields.

The direction value is `"asc"` for ascending, and `"desc"` for descending.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="defaultdirectionvalue">If you omit the direction value,
the default `"asc"` is used.</aside>

> Example of simple sort syntax:

```json
[{"fieldName1": "desc"}, {"fieldName2": "desc" }]
```

> Example of simple sort, assuming default ascending direction for both fields:

```json
["fieldNameA", "fieldNameB"]
```

<div></div>

A typical requirement is to search for some content using a selector,
then to sort the results according to the specified field, in the required direction.

To use sorting, ensure that:

-	At least one of the sort fields is included in the selector.
-	There is an index already defined, with all the sort fields in the same order.
-	Each object in the sort array has a single key.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="singlekeyeffect">If an object in the sort array does not have a single key, the resulting sort order is implementation specific and might change.</aside>

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="nodifferentsortbyfield">Currently, Cloudant Query does not support multiple fields with different sort orders, so the directions must be either all ascending or all descending.</aside>

If the direction is ascending, you can use a string instead of an object to specify the sort fields.

For field names in text search sorts, it is
sometimes necessary for a field type to be specified,
for example:

	`{ "fieldname:string": "asc" }`

If possible,
an attempt is made to discover the field type based on the selector.
In ambiguous cases the field type must be provided explicitly.

The following table clarifies when the field type must be specified:

Index used by query                       | Field type requirement
------------------------------------------|-----------------------
JSON index                                | It is not necessary to specify the type of sort fields in the query.
Text index of all fields in all documents | Specify the type of any sort field in the query if the database contains any documents in which the sort field has one type _and also_ contains some documents in which the sort field has a different type.
Any other text index                      | Specify the type of all sort fields in the query.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="textindexcreation">Remember that a text index of all fields
in all documents is created when you use the syntax: [`"index": {}`](cloudant_query.html#the-index-field).</aside>

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="sortorderundefined">The sorting order is undefined when fields contain different data types.
This is an important difference between text and view indexes.
Sorting behavior for fields with different data types might change in future versions.</aside>

> A simple query, using sorting:

```json
{
    "selector": {"Actor_name": "Robert De Niro"},
    "sort": [{"Actor_name": "asc"}, {"Movie_runtime": "asc"}]
}
```

### Filtering fields

It is possible to specify exactly which fields are returned for a document when selecting from a database.
The two advantages are:

- Your results are limited to only those parts of the document that are required for your application.
- A reduction in the size of the response.

The fields returned are specified as an array.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="onlyfilterfields">Only the specified filter fields are included, in the response.
There is no automatic inclusion of the `_id` or other metadata fields when a field list is included.</aside>

> Example of selective retrieval of fields from matching documents:

```json
{
    "selector": { "Actor_name": "Robert De Niro" },
    "fields": ["Actor_name", "Movie_year", "_id", "_rev"]
}
```

### Explain Plans

Cloudant Query chooses which index to use for responding to a query,
unless you specify an index at query time.

When choosing which index to use,
Cloudant Query uses the following logic:

-	If there are two or more `json` type indexes on the same fields, the index with the smallest number of fields in the index is preferred. If there are still two or more candidate indexes, the index with the first alphabetical name is chosen.
-	If a `json` type index _and_ a `text` type index could both satisfy a selector, the `json` index is chosen by default.
-	If a `json` type index _and_ a `text` type index the same field (for example `fieldone`), but the selector can only be satisfied by using a `text` type index, then the `text` type index is chosen.

For example, assume you have a `text` type index and a `json` type index for the field `foo`,
and you want to use a selector similar to the following:

  `{"foo": {"$in": ["red","blue","green"]}}`

Cloudant Query uses the `text` type index,
because a `json` type index cannot satisfy the selector.

However,
you might use a different selector with the same indexes:

  `{"foo": {"$gt": 2}}`

In this example,
Cloudant Query uses the `json` type index because both types of indexes could satisfy the selector.

<div></div>

To identify which index is being used by a particular query,
send a `POST` to the `_explain` endpoint for the database,
with the query as data.
The details of the index in use are shown in the `index` object within the result.

> Example showing how to identify the index used to answer a query:

```http

To instruct a query to use a specific index,
add the `use_index` parameter to the query.
The value of the `use_index` parameter takes one of two formats:

-	`"use_index": "<design_document>"`
-	`"use_index": ["<design_document>","<index_name"]`

> Example query with instructions to use a specific index:

```json
{
  "selector": {
    "$text": "Pacino",
    "year": 2010
  },
  "use_index": "_design/32372935e14bed00cc6db4fc9efca0f1537d34a8"
}
```

### Note about `text` indexes

The basic premise for full text indexes is that a document is "expanded" into a list of key/value pairs that are indexed by Lucene.
This allows us to make use of Lucene's search syntax as a basis for the query capability.

While supporting enhanced searches, this technique does have certain limitations.
For example, it might not always be clear whether content for an expanded document came from individual elements or an array.

The query mechanism resolves this by preferring to return 'false positive' results.
In other words,
if a match would have be found as a result of searching for either an individual element,
or an element from an array,
then the match is considered to have succeeded.

#### Selector Translation

A standard Lucene search expression would not necessarily fully 'understand' Cloudant's JSON based query syntax. Therefore, a translation between the two formats takes place.

In the example given,
the JSON query approximates to the English phrase:
"match if the age expressed as a number is greater than five and less than or equal to infinity".
The Lucene query corresponds to that phrase,
where the text `_3a` within the fieldname corresponds to the `age:number` field,
and is an example of the document content expansion mentioned earlier.

> Example query to be translated

```json
{"age": {"$gt": 5}}
```

> Corresponding Lucene query

```
(age_3anumber:{5 TO Infinity])
```

#### A more complex example

This example illustrates some important points.

In the `{"$exists":true}` JSON query,
we use a two clause `OR` query for the `twitter` field, ending in `_3a*` and `_2e*`. This clause
searches the `$fieldnames` field for entries that contain either `twitter.*` or `twitter:*`. The
reason is to match when the value is an array _or_ an object. Implementing
this as two phrases instead of a single `twitter*` query prevents an accidental match
with a field name such as `twitter_handle` or similar.

The last of the three main clauses, where we search for `starch` or `protein`, is more complicated.
The `$in` operator has some
special semantics for array values that are inherited from MongoDB's documented behavior.
In particular, the `$in` operator applies to the value **OR** any of the values contained in an array named by the
given field. In our example, this means that both `"type":"starch"` **AND** `"type":["protein"]` would
match the example argument to `$in`.
We saw earlier that `type_3astring` translates to
`type:string`. The second `type_2e_5b_5d_3astring` phrase translates to `type.[]:string`,
which is an example of the expanded array indexing.

> JSON query to be translated

```json
{
  "$or": [
  {"age": {"$gt": 5}},
  {"twitter":{"$exists":true}},
  {"type": {"$in": [
    "starch",
    "protein"
  ]}}
  ]
}
```

> Corresponding Lucene query<br/>(the '#' comment is not valid Lucene syntax, but helps explain the query construction):

```
(
# Search for age > 5
(age_3anumber:{5 TO Infinity])
# Search for documents containing the twitter field
(($fieldnames:twitter_3a*) OR ($fieldnames:twitter_2e*))
# Search for type = starch
(
((type_3astring:starch) OR (type_2e_5b_5d_3astring:starch))
# Search for type = protein
((type_3astring:protein) OR (type_2e_5b_5d_3astring:protein))
)
)
```

### Example: Movies Demo Database

To describe full text indexes,
it is helpful to have a large collection of data to work with.
A suitable collection is available in the example Cloudant Query movie database: `query-movies`.
You can obtain a copy of this database in your database, with the name `my-movies`,
by running the command shown.

The sample database contains approximately 3,000 documents, and is just under 1 MB in size.

> Obtaining a copy of the Cloudant Query movie database:

```http
POST /_replicator HTTP/1.1
Host: user.cloudant.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "source": "https://examples.cloudant.com/query-movies",
  "target": "https://<user:password>@<user>.cloudant.com/my-movies",
  "create_target": true,
  "use_checkpoints": false
}
```

```shell
curl 'https://<user:password>@<user>.cloudant.com/_replicator' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "source": "https://examples.cloudant.com/query-movies",
    "target": "https://<user:password>@<user>.cloudant.com/my-movies",
    "create_target": true,
    "use_checkpoints": false
}'
```

> Results after successful replication of the Cloudant Query movie database:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "use_checkpoints": false
}
```

<div></div>

Before we can search the content, we must index it. We do this by creating a text index for the documents.

> Creating a _text_ index for your sample database:

```http
POST /my-movies/_index HTTP/1.1
Host: user.cloudant.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "index": {},
  "type": "text"
}
```

```shell
curl 'https://<user:password>@<user>.cloudant.com/my-movies/_index' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"index": {}, "type": "text"}'
```

> Response after creating a text index:

```json
{
  "result": "created"
}
```

<div></div>

The most obvious difference in the results you get when using full text indexes is the inclusion of a large `bookmark` field.
The reason is that text indexes are different to view-based indexes.
For more flexibility when working with the results obtained from a full text query, you can supply the `bookmark` value as part of the request body.
Using the `bookmark` enables you to specify which page of results you require.
