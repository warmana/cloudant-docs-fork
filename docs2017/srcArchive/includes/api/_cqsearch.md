## Query Text Indexes

Cloudant Query has support for [creating indexes](cloudant_query.html#creating-an-index)
using [Apache Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/).
This capability provides several benefits, including:

-	Full Text Indexing (FTI)
-	Simple 'ad hoc' queries across multiple fields, without restrictions

This guide describes the features, and explains how to use them.

### Overview

To get the benefits from Full Text Indexing (FTI),
you should already be familiar with the basics of using Cloudant.

There are four basic steps to work with FTI:

<div id="step01"></div>
#### 1. Create a database, or use an existing database

> Example command to create a Cloudant database:

```http
PUT /dbname HTTP/1.1
Host: user.cloudant.com
```

```shell
curl -X PUT https://user.cloudant.com/dbname
```

<div id="step02"></div>
#### 2. Create a text index

> Example command to create a text index within the database:

```http
POST /dbname/_index HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: user.cloudant.com

{
  "index": {},
  "type": "text"
}
```

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://user.cloudant.com/dbname/_index \
  -d '{"index":{}, "type": "text"}'
```

<div id="step03"></div>
#### 3. Add a document

> Example command to create a simple document:

```http
POST /dbname HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: user.cloudant.com

{
  "character":"Frodo Baggins",
  "type": "Hobbit",
  "height":4
}
```

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://user.cloudant.com/dbname \
  -d '{"character":"Frodo Baggins", "type": "Hobbit", "height":4}'
```

<div id="step04"></div>
#### 4. Query for the document

> Example command to query for a document that has a field containing the text "Frodo", using a case-insensitive match:

```http
POST /dbname/_find HTTP/1.1
HOST: user.cloudant.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "selector": {
    "$text": "Frodo"
  }
}
```

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://user.cloudant.com/dbname/_find \
  -d '{"selector":{"$text": "Frodo"}}'
```

> Example command to query for a document that matches a condition:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://user.cloudant.com/dbname/_find \
  -d '{"selector":{"$or": [{"type":"Orc"}, {"height": {"$lt":4.5}}]}'
```

### Index Creation Parameters

> Example index creation request

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "name": "my-index",
  "ddoc": "my-index-design-doc",
  "w": "2",
  "index": {
    "default_field": {
      "enabled": true,
      "analyzer": "german"
    }
    "selector": {}
    "fields": [
      {"name": "married", "type": "boolean"},
      {"name": "lastname", "type": "string"},
      {"name": "year-of-birth", "type": "number"}
    ]
  }
}
```

While it is generally recommended that you create a single text index with the default values there
are a few useful index attributes that can be modified.

For text indexes, `type` should be set to `text`.

The `name` and `ddoc` attributes are for grouping indexes into design documents and allowing them to be referred to by a
custom string value. If no values are supplied for these fields, they are automatically
populated with a hash value. If you create multiple text indexes in a database, with
the same `ddoc` value, you need to
know at least the `ddoc` value as well as the `name` value.
Creating multiple indexes with the same `ddoc` value places them into the
same design document. Generally, you should put each text index into its own design document.

The `w` value affects the consistency of the index creation operation. In general use, you
shouldn't have to worry about this, but if you create test or example scripts that attempt to use
the index immediately after use, it can be useful to set this to `3`, so that a complete quorum is
used for the creation. It does not affect anything other than index creation.

The `index` field contains settings specific to text indexes.

The `default_field` value affects how the index for handling the `$text` operator is created. In
almost all cases this should be left enabled. Do this by setting the value to `true`,
or simply not including the enabled field.

The `analyzer` key in the `default_field` can be used to choose how to analyze text included
in the index. See the [Cloudant Search documentation](./search.html#analyzers) for alternative analyzers.
You might choose to use an alternative analyzer when documents are indexed in languages other than English,
or when you have other special requirements for the analyser such as matching email addresses.

The `selector` field can be used to limit the index to a specific set of documents that match
a query. It uses the same syntax used for selectors in queries. This can be used if your application
requires different documents to be indexed in different ways, or if some documents should not be indexed at all.
If you only need to distinguish documents by type, it is easier to use one index and add the type to the search query.

The `fields` array contains a list of fields that should be indexed for each document. If you
know that an index queries only on specific fields, then this can be used to limit
the size of the index. Each field must also specify a type to be indexed. The acceptable
types are `"boolean"` , `"string"`, and `"number"`.

<!-- An explanation of what these types mean can be found in the implementation notes. -->

### Query Parameters

> Example using all available query parameters

```json
{
  "selector": {
    "query": "here"
  },
  "fields": [
    "_id",
    "_rev",
    "foo",
    "bar"
  ],
  "sort": [
    {
      "bar:number": "asc"
    },
    {
      "foo:string": "asc"
    }
  ],
  "bookmark": "opaque string",
  "limit": 10,
  "skip": 0
}
```

The format of the `selector` field is as described in the [Cloudant Query documentation](query.html) with the
exception of the new `$text` operator. This operator applies to all strings found in the
document. In the selector, it must be placed at the very top level. It is invalid to place this
operator in the context of a field name.

The `fields` array is a list of fields that should be returned for each document. The provided
field names can use dotted notation to access subfields.

<!-- Array elements can be accessed using integers indexes. -->

The `sort` field contains a list of field name and direction pairs. For field names in text search sorts, it is
sometimes necessary for a field type to be specified, as shown in the example. If possible, an
attempt is made to discover the field type based on the selector. In ambiguous cases the field type must
be provided explicitly.

<!-- You can discover the reason for this type specification in the following
implementation notes. -->

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="sortorderundefined">The sorting order is undefined when fields contain different data types. This is an important difference between text and view indexes. Sorting behavior for fields with different data types might change in future versions.</aside>

The `bookmark` field is used for paging through result sets. Every query returns an opaque
string under the `bookmark` key that can then be passed back in a query to get the next page of
results. If any part of the query other than `bookmark` changes between requests, the results are
undefined.

The `limit` and `skip` values are exactly as you would expect. While `skip` exists, it is not
intended to be used for paging. The reason is that the `bookmark` feature
is more efficient.

### Example: Movies Demo Database

> Obtaining a copy of the Cloudant Query movie database:

```http
POST /_replicator HTTP/1.1
Host: user.cloudant.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "source": "https://examples.cloudant.com/movies-demo",
  "target": "https://<user:password>@<user>.cloudant.com/my-movies-demo",
  "create_target": true,
  "use_checkpoints": false
}
```

```shell
curl 'https://<user:password>@<user>.cloudant.com/_replicator' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "source": "https://examples.cloudant.com/movies-demo",
    "target": "https://<user:password>@<user>.cloudant.com/my-movies-demo",
    "create_target": true,
    "use_checkpoints": false
}'
```

> Results after successful replication of the Cloudant Query movie database:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "use_checkpoints": false
}
```

To describe FTI, it is helpful to have a large collection of data to work with.
A suitable collection is available in the example Cloudant Query movie database: `movies-demo`.
You can obtain a copy of this database in your database, with the name `my-movies-demo`,
by running the command shown.

The sample database contains approximately 3,000 documents, and is just under 1 MB in size.

<div></div>

> Creating a _text_ index for your sample database:

```http
POST /my-movies-demo/_index HTTP/1.1
Host: user.cloudant.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "index": {},
  "type": "text"
}
```

```shell
curl 'https://<user:password>@<user>.cloudant.com/my-movies-demo/_index' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"index": {}, "type": "text"}'
```

> Response after creating a text index:

```json
{
  "result": "created"
}
```

Before we can search the content, we must index it. We do this by creating a text index for the documents.

<div></div>

> Searching for a specific document within the database:

```http
POST /my-movies-demo/_find HTTP/1.1
Host: user.cloudant.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "selector": {
    "Person_name":"Zoe Saldana"
  }
}
```

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        https://<user:password>@<user>.cloudant.com/my-movies-demo/_find \
        -d '{"selector": {"Person_name":"Zoe Saldana"}}'
```

> Example result from the search:

```json
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "_id": "d9e6a7ae2363d6cfe81af75a3941110b",
      "_rev": "1-556aec0e89fa13769fbf59d651411528",
      "Movie_runtime": 162,
      "Movie_rating": "PG-13",
      "Person_name": "Zoe Saldana",
      "Movie_genre": "AVYS",
      "Movie_name": "Avatar",
      "Movie_earnings_rank": "1",
      "Person_pob": "New Jersey, USA",
      "Movie_year": 2009,
      "Person_dob": "1978-06-19"
    }
  ],
  "bookmark": "g2wA ... Omo"
}
```

The most obvious difference in the results you get when using FTI is the inclusion of a large `bookmark` field. The reason is that text indexes are different to view-based indexes. For more flexibility when working with the results obtained from an FTI query, you can supply the `bookmark` value as part of the request body. Using the `bookmark` enables you to specify which page of results you require.

<aside class="notice" role="complementary" aria-label="bookmarklong">The actual `bookmark` value is very long, so the examples here are truncated for reasons of clarity.</aside>

  }
}
```

```shell

      "Person_dob": "1943-08-17"
    }
  ],
  "bookmark": "g2w ... c2o"
}
```

    }
  ],
  "bookmark": "g2w ... c2o"
}
```

#### The $text operator

The `$text` operator is based on a Lucene search with a standard analyzer. This means the operator is not case sensitive, and matches on any words.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="textnotfulllucene">The `$text` operator does not support full Lucene syntax, such as wildcards, fuzzy matches, or proximity detection.
For more information on the available Lucene syntax, have a look at the [Cloudant Search documentation](search.html).</aside>

The resulting query is `AND`'ed with the rest of the selector.

NEED AN EXAMPLE HERE.

### Other information

The basic premise for FTI is that a document is "expanded" into a list of key/value pairs that are indexed by Lucene. This allows us to make use of Lucene's search syntax as a basis for the query capability.

```

The key underpinnings of text indexes is how they're translated to be stored in the Lucene
indexes. This uses a standard approach to breaking a JSON document into a list of key/value
pairs where the key is a dotted path and the value is either `null`, `true`, `false`, a string, or
number.

The paths used for keys are fairly standard with a notable exception for arrays. Perhaps
the easiest way to explain is by example.

There are a couple of things that should immediately stick out. Each field name ends up with its type
appended to the end. This means if two documents that both have a field named `"zipcode"`
where one document has a value `68130` and another document has the value `"68130-2579"`
(notice that is a number first and string second) the end result will be an index with two different
fields, one named `zipcode:number` and one named `zipcode:string`.

Most of the time this type distinction can be hidden from the user. In general we can infer types
in selectors and so on. Occasionally though we require that the user must specify a type
manually. The most important place for this is probably when specifying a sort. We do attempt
to inspect the selector but if the selector either contains the same field with multiple types, or
doesn't contain the field at all then we return an error instructing the user to specify the type.

Along with indexes over all the fields there are two other important fields that are generated. The
first is a `$default` field which contains all of the string values using the `default_field`
analyzer for indexing. This can currently be disabled but that may or may not be something
we'll want to keep as an option. This field is only ever used for the `$text` operator's default
field.

The second important default index is the `$fieldnames` index. This index contains the
complete list of field names for each document. We rely heavily on this index to support some
specific queries. For instance, the `$exists` operator can make obvious use of this index by
specifying a query like `$fieldnames:stages.[].thrust` which would return every document
with a field named `stages` that contains an array that has at least one object with the key
`thrust`.

The only other thing to note is that we escape all field names with a url-escape-like approach.
Although rather than use the `%` character we use `_` and aggressively escape any non-
alphanumeric bytes.

### Index Lookup Post-Filtering

> Example document

```json
{
  "_id": "washer",
  "contents": [
    {
      "type": "shirt",
      "color": "red",
      "size": "large"
    }
  ]
}
```

> Exploded field/value list

```
_id:string                "washer"
contents.[].color:string  "red"
contents.[].size:string   "large"
contents.[].type:string   "shirt"
```

> Example document

```json
{
  "_id": "dresser",
  "contents": [
    {
      "type": "socks",
      "color": "red",
      "size": "small"
    },
    {
      "type": "pants",
      "color": "blue",
      "size": "medium"
    },
    {
      "type": "shirt",
      "color": "black",
      "size": "large"
    }
  ]
}
```

> Exploded field/value list

```
_id:string                  "dresser"
contents.[].color:string    "black"
contents.[].color:string    "blue"
contents.[].color:string    "red"
contents.[].size:string     "large"
contents.[].size:string     "medium"
contents.[].size:string     "small"
contents.[].type:string     "pants"
contents.[].type:string     "shirt"
contents.[].type:string     "socks"

While supporting enhanced searches, this technique does have certain limitations.

For example, it might not always be clear whether content for an expanded document came from individual elements or an array.

The query mechanism resolves this by preferring to return 'false positive' results. In other words, if a match would have be found as a result of searching for either an individual element, or an element from an array, then the match is considered to have succeeded.

<!--
As the astute observer will have noticed there are a number of queries that are not directly
answerable using the given scheme described earlier. A good example would be searching
using the `$elemMatch` operator which applies to objects in arrays. Given that we erase array
position of fields we are unable to determine the difference between field names originating from
separate elemnts. Consider a search for large red shirts with the following documents:


Because of the way the conversion to field/value pairs is done, there is no way to tell whether any particular field value came from a specific element of
an array. Instead, the approach taken is to ensure that all documents  - including false
positives - are returned by the initial index lookup and then apply a filtering step to make sure only the correct documents are returned. The key here is to
always ensure that queries don't have false *negatives* at the expense of filtering out the possible false positives.

With the post-lookup filtering, searching for large red shirts is possible by
returning both documents from the index and discarding the dresser document.

#### Selector Translation

> Example query to be translated

```json
{"age": {"$gt": 5}}
```

> Corresponding Lucene query

```
(age_3anumber:{5 TO Infinity])
```

A standard Lucene search expression would not necessarily fully 'understand' Cloudant's JSON based query syntax. Therefore, a translation between the two formats takes place.

In the example given, the JSON query approximates to the English phrase: "match if the age expressed
as a number is greater than five and less than or equal to infinity". The Lucene query corresponds to that phrase, where the text `_3a` within the fieldname corresponds to the `age:number` field, and is an example of the document content expansion mentioned earlier.

#### A more complex example

> JSON query to be translated

```json
{
  "$or": [
  {"age": {"$gt": 5}},
  {"twitter":{"$exists":true}},
  {"type": {"$in": [
    "starch",
    "protein"
  ]}}
  ]
}
```

> Corresponding Lucene query<br/>(the '#' comment is not valid Lucene syntax, but helps explain the query construction):

```
(
# Search for age > 5
(age_3anumber:{5 TO Infinity])
# Search for documents containing the twitter field
(($fieldnames:twitter_3a*) OR ($fieldnames:twitter_2e*))
# Search for type = starch
(
((type_3astring:starch) OR (type_2e_5b_5d_3astring:starch))
# Search for type = protein
((type_3astring:protein) OR (type_2e_5b_5d_3astring:protein))
)
)
```

This example illustrates some important points.

In the `{"$exists":true}` JSON query,
we use a two clause `OR` query for the `twitter` field, ending in `_3a*` and `_2e*`. This clause
searches the `$fieldnames` field for entries that contain either `twitter.*` or `twitter:*`. The
reason is to match when the value is an array _or_ an object. Implementing
this as two phrases instead of a single `twitter*` query prevents an accidental match
with a field name such as `twitter_handle` or similar.

The last of the three main clauses, where we search for `starch` or `protein`, is more complicated.
The `$in` operator has some
special semantics for array values that are inherited from MongoDB's documented behavior.
In particular, the `$in` operator applies to the value **OR** any of the values contained in an array named by the
given field. In our example, this means that both `"type":"starch"` **AND** `"type":["protein"]` would
match the example argument to `$in`.
We saw earlier that `type_3astring` translates to
`type:string`. The second `type_2e_5b_5d_3astring` phrase translates to `type.[]:string`,
which is an example of the expanded array indexing.

<!--
It should be noted that the current system of tranlsating to Lucene's QueryParser syntax is
actually bit of a weak link in our system. This is due to the requirement that we match the
escaping semantics of the QueryParser exactly so that values are passed through Lucene's
analyzers correctly. A future improvement will be to upgrade the Cloudant Search infrastructure
to accept a JSON description of the query that will then be directly translated into Lucene's
query objects rathern than having to serialize through the QueryParser syntax.
