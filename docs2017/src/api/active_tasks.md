# Active tasks

The `/_active_tasks` endpoint provides a list of the tasks running on the server.
This is often helpful when [monitoring](monitoring.html) the performance of your system.
For more examples on using the `/_active_tasks` endpoint,
see the [Managing tasks](../guides/managing_tasks.html) guide.
{:shortdesc}

## Retrieving a list of active tasks

-   **Method**: `GET`
-   **Path**: `/_active_tasks`
-   **Response**: List of running tasks, including the task type, name, status and process ID
-   **Roles permitted**: `_admin`

You can obtain a list of active tasks by using the `/_active_tasks` URL.
The result is a JSON array of the currently running tasks,
with each task being described with a single object.

_Example request to retrieve list of active tasks using HTTP:_

```HTTP
GET /_active_tasks HTTP/1.1
```
{:codeblock}

_Example request to retrieve list of active tasks, using the command line:_

```sh
curl https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/_active_tasks \
	-u $USERNAME
```
{:codeblock}

_Example request to retrieve list of active tasks using Javascript:_

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano('https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com');
account.request({
	path: '_active_tasks'
}, function (err, body) {
	if (!err) {
		console.log(body);
	}
});
```
{:codeblock}

The returned structure includes the following fields for each task:

-   **database**: The database and shard on which the operation occurs.
-   **pid**: Erlang Process ID
-   **started_on**: Time when the task was started.
	The value is an integer containing the Unix time UTC.
-   **total_changes**: Total number of documents to be processed by the task.
	The exact meaning depends on the type of the task.
-   **type**: Operation Type
-   **updated_on**: Time when the last update was made to this task record.
	Updates are made by the job as progress occurs.
	The value is an integer containing the Unix time using UTC.

In the `type` field,
the possible values include:

-   `database_compaction`
-   `view_compaction`
-   `replication`
-   `indexer`
-   `search_indexer`

The meaning of other fields in the JSON response depends on the type of the task.

### Specific response fields for compaction tasks

-   **changes_done**: Number of documents compacted.
-   **phase**: Reports the stage of compaction.
-   **total_changes**: Number of documents in the database.

In the `phase` field, the value indicates the stage that compaction has reached:

-   `ids`: Document compaction is in progress.
-   `views`: View compaction is in progress.

### Specific response fields for replication tasks

-   **changes_pending**: Number of documents needing to be changed in the target database,
	expressed as an integer.
-   **continuous**: Boolean value indicating whether the replication is continuous.
-   **docs_read**: Number of documents read from the source database,
	expressed as an integer.
-   **replication_id**: Unique identifier string of the replication that can be used to cancel the task.
-   **revisions_checked**: Number of document revisions for which it was checked
	whether they are already in the target database.
-   **source**: An obfuscated URL string indicating the database from which the task is replicating.
-   **target**: An obfuscated URL string indicating the database to which the task is replicating.
-   **user**: User who started the replication, expressed as a string,
	or `null` if the replication was not initiated by a user.

### Specific response fields for indexing tasks

-   **changes_done**: Number of document revisions processed by this task.
	A document can have one or more revisions.
-   **design_document**: The design document containing the view or index function or functions.
-   **total_changes**: The number of unindexed changes to process. This count includes deleted documents,
	though these are automatically skipped by the indexer.
