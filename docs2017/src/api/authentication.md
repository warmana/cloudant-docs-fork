# Authentication

Authentication means proving who you are.
This is typically done by providing your user credentials for verification.
{:shortdesc}

There are two ways that clients can provide credentials (authenticate)
for Cloudant:

-	[Basic authentication](#basic-authentication).
-	[Cookie authentication](#cookie-authentication).

Basic authentication is similar to showing an ID at a door, to be checked every time you want to enter.
Cookie authentication is similar to having a key to the door so that you can let yourself in whenever you want.
Within Cloudant,
the key is a cookie named `AuthSession`.

>	**Note**: When creating or using performance-critical Cloudant applications,
Cookie authentication has benefits compared with Basic authentication.
Therefore,
you should prefer Cookie authentication where possible.

## Basic Authentication

To use Basic authentication,
pass along your credentials as part of every request.
You do this by adding an `Authorization` header to the request.

The header contains the authentication scheme (`Basic`),
followed by the [BASE64 ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64){:new_window} encoding of a string created by concatenating:

-	Your username.
-	The `:` character.
-	Your password.

In practice,
many application libraries that are used for creating HTTP requests can do this encoding for you.

_Example including basic authentication credentials in a request, using HTTP:_

```http
GET /db/document HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```
{:codeblock}

_Example including basic authentication credentials in a request, using the command line:_

```sh
curl https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com
```
{:codeblock}

_Example including basic authentication credentials in a request, using Javascript:_

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com");
account.request(function (err, body) {
	if (!err) {
		console.log(body);
	}
});
```
{:codeblock}

_Example including basic authentication credentials in a request, using Python:_

```python
import cloudant
url = "https://{0}:{1}@{0}.cloudant.com".format(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
account = cloudant.Account(url)
ping = account.get()
print ping.status_code
# Expected result code: 200
```
{:codeblock}

## Cookie Authentication

Cookie authentication requires you to supply a valid username and password once,
at the start of a series of tasks (the session).
The response includes a cookie,
generated by the server,
that confirms you have successfully authenticated.
Once created,
you send the cookie with all requests that require you to be authenticated.

The presence of a valid cookie is sufficient to ensure that your call request is processed
rather than rejected immediately as unauthenticated.
You can use the cookie until it expires.

Using the `DELETE` method has the effect of logging the user out,
because the cookie is considered by the server to have expired.

Method | Path | Description | Headers | Form Parameters
-------|------|-------------|---------|----------------------
`POST` | `/_session` | Do cookie based user login | `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | name, password
`GET` | `/_session` | Returns cookie based login user information | AuthSession cookie returned by POST request | —
`DELETE` | `/_session` | Logout cookie based user | AuthSession cookie returned by POST request | —

### Requesting a cookie

With Cookie authentication,
you use your credentials to acquire a cookie.
Do this by sending a `POST` request to `/_session`.

_Example of requesting a cookie, using HTTP:_

```http
POST /_session HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 32
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: */*
name=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD
```
{:codeblock}

_Example of requesting a cookie, using the command line:_

```sh
curl https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/_session \
	-X POST \
	-c /path/to/cookiefile
	-d "name=$USERNAME&password=$PASSWORD"
```
{:codeblock}

_Example of requesting a cookie, using Javascript:_

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var cloudant = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");
var cookies = {}
cloudant.auth($USERNAME, $PASSWORD, function (err, body, headers) {
	if (!err) {
		cookies[$USERNAME] = headers['set-cookie'];
		cloudant = nano({
			url: "https://"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com",
			cookie: cookies[$USERNAME] 
		});
		// ping to ensure we're logged in
		cloudant.request({
			path: 'test_porter'
		}, function (err, body, headers) {
			if (!err) {
				console.log(body, headers);
			}
		});
	}
});
```
{:codeblock}

_Example of requesting a cookie, using Python:_

```python
import cloudant
account = cloudant.Account(USERNAME)
login = account.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
print login.status_code
# Expected result code: 200
logout = account.logout()
print logout.status_code
# Expected result code: 200
all_dbs = account.all_dbs()
print all_dbs.status_code
# Expected result code: 401
```
{:codeblock}

If the credentials you supply in your cookie request are valid,
the response contains a cookie which remains active for twenty-four hours.

_Reply to request for a cookie:_

```http
200 OK
Cache-Control: must-revalidate
Content-Length: 42
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Date: Mon, 11 Nov 2016 12:43:15 GMT
server: CouchDB/1.0.2 (Erlang OTP/R14B)
Set-Cookie: AuthSession="d2FybWFuYTo1ODI1QkM2NzpZelovo2epvx9cfaDdxJGNLuzBzw"; Expires=Sat, 12 Nov 2016 12:43:15 GMT; Max-Age=86400; Path=/; HttpOnly; Version=1
x-couch-request-id: a638431d
```
{:codeblock}

_JSON part of response:_

```json
{
	"ok": true,
	"name": "USERNAME",
	"roles": []
}
```
{:codeblock}

<div id="getting-cookie-information"></div>

### Getting cookie-authenticated information

When a cookie has been set,
information about the authenticated user can be retrieved with a `GET` request.

_Example request for cookie information, using HTTP:_

```http
GET /_session HTTP/1.1
Cookie: AuthSession="d2FybWFuYTo1ODI1QkM2NzpZelovo2epvx9cfaDdxJGNLuzBzw"; Expires=Sat, 12 Nov 2016 12:43:15 GMT; Max-Age=86400; Path=/; HttpOnly; Version=1
Accept: application/json
```
{:codeblock}

_Example request for cookie information, using the command line:_

```sh
curl https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/_session \
	-X GET \
	-b /path/to/cookiefile
```
{:codeblock}

The response contains the username,
the user's roles,
and which authentication mechanism was used.

_Example response to request for cookie information:_

```json
{
	"userCtx": {
		"roles": [
			"_admin",
			"_reader",
			"_writer"
		],
		"name": "USERNAME"
	},
	"ok": true,
	"info": {
		"authentication_db": "_users",
		"authentication_handlers": [
			"delegated",
			"cookie",
			"default",
			"local"
		],
		"authenticated": "cookie"
	}
}
```
{:codeblock}

### Deleting a cookie

You can end the cookie authentication session by sending a `DELETE` request to the same URL used to create the cookie.
The `DELETE` request must include the cookie you wish to delete.

_Example cookie `DELETE` request, using HTTP:_

```http
DELETE /_session HTTP/1.1
Cookie: AuthSession="d2FybWFuYTo1ODI1QkM2NzpZelovo2epvx9cfaDdxJGNLuzBzw"; Expires=Sat, 12 Nov 2016 12:43:15 GMT; Max-Age=86400; Path=/; HttpOnly; Version=1
Accept: application/json
```
{:codeblock}

_Example cookie `DELETE` request, using the command line:_

```sh
curl https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/_session \
	-X DELETE \
	-b /path/to/cookiefile
```
{:codeblock}

The response confirms deletion of the session,
and sets the `AuthSession` Cookie to `""`.

_Example response to cookie `DELETE` request:_

```http
200 OK
Cache-Control: must-revalidate
Content-Length: 12
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Mon, 11 Nov 2016 14:06:12 GMT
server: CouchDB/1.0.2 (Erlang OTP/R14B)
Set-Cookie: AuthSession=""; Expires=Fri, 02 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; Max-Age=0; Path=/; HttpOnly; Version=1
x-couch-request-id: e02e0333
```
{:codeblock}

_JSON part of response:_

```json
{
	"ok": true
}
```
{:codeblock}
