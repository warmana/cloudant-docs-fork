# Cloudant Offerings

## Database as a Service

Cloudant is a hosted and fully-managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS).
It is built from the ground up to scale globally,
run non-stop,
and handle a wide variety of data types like [JSON](../basics/index.html#json),
[full-text](../api/cloudant_query.html#creating-an-index),
and [geospatial](../api/cloudant-geo.html).
Cloudant is an operational data store optimized to handle concurrent reads and writes,
and enables high availability and data durability.

It provides an [HTTP API](../basics/index.html#http-api) for working with your [JSON](../basics/index.html#json) data,
and 24-hour operational support and maintenance.
Cloudant is based on [Apache CouchDB ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://couchdb.apache.org/){:new_window},
and is delivered as various multi-tenant,
dedicated,
and installed services.

>   **Note**: All currency values in this document are in US dollars ($).

The Cloudant DBaaS offering is available through [https://cloudant.com/ ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloudant.com/){:new_window}.
It is offered as either a [Shared Plan](#shared-plan),
or an [Enterprise (Dedicated) Plan](#enterprise-plan).

Cloudant is also available as an [IBM Bluemix service](bluemix.html).

### Shared Plan

With the Cloudant Shared Plan,
you have access to all the Cloudant DBaaS capabilities,
provided through a shared or 'multi-tenant' cluster.

Pricing is metered,
based on your monthly usage.
There is no charge if your monthly usage is under $50.00 (as at August 2016).

For more information,
see the [pricing details ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloudant.com/product/pricing/){:new_window}.

### Enterprise Plan

With the Cloudant DBaaS Enterprise Plan,
you have access to all the Cloudant DBaaS capabilities,
provided through a dedicated, single-tenant cluster.

This gives you assured database performance and up-time,
using dedicated DBaaS clusters or hardware available at various hosting locations.
